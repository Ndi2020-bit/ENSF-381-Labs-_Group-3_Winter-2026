        <h1>Like many Calgary success stories, ours has a spirited beginning, an unprecedented
            growth spurt and a promising future.</h1>
        <tr>
            <p>Even before Alberta became a province in September 1905, the citizens of a very young Calgary were
                determined to host a post-secondary institution as part of building a great
                city.</p>
            <p>In 1906, the Alberta Normal School (which would later become our own Werklund School of Education) began
                operations and provided a steady stream of educators for a new
                province eager to grow and advance quickly</p>
            <p>When the University of Alberta was founded in 1908 in Strathcona (now part of Edmonton), Calgarians were
                disappointed with the "branch plant" concept that ensued and
                lobbied for decades for an independent institution of their own. Students, faculty, staff, alumni,
                donors and volunteers joined together to support the cause, with great passion and
                commitment.</p>
            <p>Their dedication was finally rewarded on April 29, 1966 when the University of Calgary was granted
                autonomy. From there, growth was fast and furious, as a new campus took
                shape and innovative educators came to Calgary from around the world.</p>
            <p>In 2016-17, the University of Calgary marked its 50th Anniversary as an autonomous institution.</p>
